# squido

`squido` is a dead simple static website builder which can be hosted anywhere for super fast websites and very little effort.

`squido` has baked in everything you need to run and host a website. You simply do the writing and customisation of style and layout. 

```bash
# with npm
npm install -g squido

# or with Yarn
yarn global add squido
```
